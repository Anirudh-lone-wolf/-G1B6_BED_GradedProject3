# G1B6_BED_GradedProject3
* **Problem Statement : You are required to create a CRUDS (Create, Read, Update, Delete, Search) functionality for a ticket tracker application.**
* This project is created using Spring Boot and Thymleaf (a server side view template). The Spring Boot autoconfiguration registers and configures the DispatcherServlet automatically. Therefore, we have not included the web.xml file or registered DispatcherServlet manually. The only xml file in this project is the project POM file.
